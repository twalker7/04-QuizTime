## Contribution 
I built all aspects of this application from scratch, initial using online tutorials to give me ideas, but realizing that I could create a simpler application on my own when it came down to specific implementations. My biggest divergence from conventional approaches is in how I chose to validate correct answers. I allowed each button to contain its own knowledge of when it was a valid selection --based on the current index of the quiz question array.
